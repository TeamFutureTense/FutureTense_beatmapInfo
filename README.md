## There are some problems with the component! 😯

- **If you are sure this is a component-related problem** (E.g. styling or not displaying properly), please open up an issue and describe your problem with details. Also, please attach screenshots so that I will know what is exactly going on.

- **Otherwise**, please make sure this is not a problem of tosu! Currently the new in-game overlay and lazer support of tosu is still in beta and might not work properly on your machine. You may open up an issue here but probably I cannot help a lot with that.
